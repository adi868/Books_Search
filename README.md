# Google Books Search

## Overview
This single-page application (SPA) uses React lifecycle methods to query and display books based on user searches. Using Node, Express, and MongoDB users can save books to review or purchase later.

## Usage:
Search the name of a book to receive information on the following fields:
* title - Title of the book from the Google Books API
* authors - The books's author(s) as returned from the Google Books API
* description - The book's description as returned from the Google Books API
* image - The Book's thumbnail image as returned from the Google Books API
* link - The Book's information link as returned from the Google Books API

Control your book library by saving books you may be interested in for later viewing! 

### Installation:
1. Clone the complete repository from Github.
2. Run `npm install` in the terminal. This will install the dependencies in the `package.json`. When that's done, you can run the application in the command line with `npm start`. This will open the link to the application at http://localhost:3000.

### Technology Used:
* React.js
* HTML5
* CSS3
* Node.js
* Express
* MongoDB
* Mongoose
* Javascript
* JSX
* ES6
* Bootstrap
* Various NPM packages

#### Application Organization:
This application has two pages accessible to the user. These are:
* Search
  * User can search for books via the Google Books API and render them here. User has the option to "View" a book, bringing them to the book on Google Books, or "Save" a book, saving it to the Mongo database.

* Saved
  * Renders all books saved to the Mongo database. User has an option to "View" the book, bringing them to the book on Google Books, or "Delete" a book, removing it from the Mongo database.
  
By creating API routes using Express these routes are available:

* /api/books (get) - Should return all saved books as JSON.
* /api/books (post) - Will be used to save a new book to the database.
* /api/books/:id (delete) - Will be used to delete a book from the database by Mongo _id.
* `*` (get) - Will load your single HTML page in client/build/index.html.

This application has its UI broken into components using React. The components are as follows:
* Book
* Card
* Footer
* Grid
* Jumbotron
* List
* Nav

#### About Using React:

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
